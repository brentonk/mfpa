## Empty set is a subset of all sets
One way to formulate the definition of a subset (@def-subset) is to say that $A \subseteq B$ means: if $x \in A$, then $x \in B$.
Keeping this in mind, take any set $A$.
It is [trivially true]{.underline} that if $x \in \emptyset$, then $x \in A$ --- because, in fact, there is no $x \in \emptyset$.
Therefore, using our reformulation of the definition of subset, we would say that $\emptyset \subseteq A$ for all sets $A$.

Prove that $A \cap B = A \cup B$ if and only if $A = B$.

## Answer
First, to prove the "if" direction, assume $A = B$.
